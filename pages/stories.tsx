                                From Jan 2024 - Mar 2024, I had the privilege to explore all over India and Sri Lanka. I ventured through very different climates and landscapes ranging from the snowcap mountains in the Himalayan region of Sikkim, to the tea plantations in Munnar, and finally all the way to the pristine water and perfect sand beaches of Sri Lanka. I really got a dose of everything.

                                Growing up, my family and I visited India once every two years. But, we would only visit family, so my idea of India was basically the crowded and noisy streets of Mumbai. However, I knew that India had a lot more to offer, so after some extensive research, I decided to jot down a couple of places I would visit after I graduated from college.

                                <strong>Sikkim</strong><br />
                                Located on a thin strip of land between Nepal and Bhutan, Sikkim is home to the worldâ€™s third tallest mountain, Mount Kanchenjunga.

                                <strong>Sri Lanka</strong><br />
                                Though not a part of India, Sri Lanka is often visited in conjunction with southern India tours. This island nation is renowned for its pristine beaches, ancient ruins, and rich cultural history. The lush tea plantations of the central highlands, the colonial architecture, and the vibrant wildlife in its national parks make Sri Lanka a diverse and fascinating destination.

                                <strong>Munnar</strong><br />
                                On the horizon and in every direction, all you see are tea leaves. Munnar, located in the Western Ghats of Kerala, India, is a popular hill station known for its sprawling tea gardens, misty mountains, and pleasant climate. The region is a paradise for trekkers and nature enthusiasts, with its rolling hills, emerald-green landscapes, and exotic flora and fauna. Munnar is also home to several wildlife sanctuaries and offers a serene escape from the hustle and bustle of city life.
